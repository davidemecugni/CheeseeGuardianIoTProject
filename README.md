# CheeseGuardian IoT project
Research project for IoT class managed by prof. David Chieng at Nottingham Ningbo University China.

The project uses a Wio Terminal microcontroller with soil, humidity, temperature, CO2, tVOC and accelerometer
sensors.
I developed an integrated solution that could be implemented in a food manufacturing plant to monitor the storage area.
The case study and business implementation focuses on the cheese manufacturing vertical in Italy.

The CheeseGuardian uses edge-computing to detect natural disasters(earthquake, fire, flood) and saves the sensors0 measurements in a off-site SQLite3 DB through MQTT.

A final dashboard is used to provide the end user with an easily operable UI.

Further description is provided in the .pdf file.
