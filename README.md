# Cheeseguardian IoT project
Research project for IoT class managed by prof. David Chieng at Nottingham Ningbo University China.

Using Wio Terminal microcontroller with soil humidity sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, CO2 and tVOC air sensor and accelerometer
I developed an integrated solution that could be implemented in a food manufacturing plant to monitor the storage area.

The CheeseGuardian uses edge-computing to detect natural disasters(earthquake, fire, flood) and saves the reading in an off-site SQLite3 DB through MQTT.
Further description is provided in the .pdf file.
